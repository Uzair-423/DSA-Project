# DSA-Project

**Introduction**
Our code finds the shortest path between a starting and an ending block on a grid, while avoiding any obstructions.
- It implements the Astar algorithm to find the shortest path 

To run this code you will need to install pygame
To do that type "pip install pygame" in the terminal (without the quotes)
* For mac replace 'pip' with 'pip3'

Add both files to a folder,
Open the folder in your code editor of choice (We used VScode) or run directly.

Run the main.py file and the GUI window(pygame) will pop up.
- Choose a suitable block on the grid and click it, [selected block will turn BLUE]
- - This is the starting block
- Move mouse to any other location and click again, [selected block will turn MAROON]
- - This the end block
- **Optional:** Drag mouse on grid, [selected blocks turn BLACK]
- - These are the barriers 
- Press 'Enter' or 'Return'(Mac) to run the code

Use 'R' key to reset the grid
